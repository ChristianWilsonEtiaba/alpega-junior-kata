# AlpegaJuniorKata

* It is a kata for a candidate who applies to front-end junior developer.

* We want to know your way to do some things.

* If you don't know how to do any points, you don't worry. Try to do only the things you feel confortable.

## Requirements
* You will need, at least, node 12 installed in your machine

## Install the app
```bash
npm install
```

## Execute the app
```bash
npm start

open a browser accessing to --> http://localhost:4200/
```

## Execute the unit tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Kata description

### MUST
* Break down AppComponent content into smaller components (It contains a lot of logic and it is not a good pattern)
* Add a delete event to be able to remove todos from the list
* Improve UI at design level (NOTES: we used Tailwind CSS framework. It is not needed to use it in order to improve the design)

### OPTIONAL
* Could we improve the way we load the todo list? maybe you can use a service to provide this array...
* add an enabled/disabled field to the Todo type, add it to the todos array and UI list. With that new field users should be able to disable/enable todos than should be showed with disable/enable style
* If you break down AppComponent into smaller components, take into account that maybe you will have to move unit test into focused unit test for each one

## IMPORTANT NOTE
PLEASE! you don't share this kata with any other. It is only a level test for candidates who apply this role for Alpega.

Thanks in advance for understanding it and happy coding :)
